## Students Comments - What are your expectations of the course?
As someone who's not from a technological academic background *per se* and who's learning journey has been pretty much as a self-starter, being part of a more formal educationn strategy, such as this crash course, is an exciting opportunity to deepen them knowledge in programming. Even though I've deployed some applications in Heroku, I hope this course introduces me to improve the way this is done and also how to do it in a work enviroment context, or at least when working with others. Finally, I hope I get to know a broad set of tools for deploying applications, specially those surging nowadays such as dockers.
